/**
 * Telecode's tool-approval policy — the single source of truth for whether a tool the agent wants to run
 * may proceed automatically (`allow`) or must be forwarded to the human for a decision (`ask`).
 *
 * This is deliberately telecode's own policy, NOT the Agent SDK's. In the SDK's `default` mode an internal
 * classifier silently auto-allows tools it deems "safe" (reads, some bash) without ever invoking
 * `canUseTool` — which would let consequential commands run on the user's machine before the operator sees
 * them, breaking the approval gate that is telecode's safety boundary (architecture invariant #4). So the
 * adapter forces EVERY tool through this policy (a `PreToolUse` hook), and the daemon's gate applies it
 * again — the relay/browser only ever see the calls this function classifies as `ask`.
 *
 * `mode` is the session's permission mode (chosen at launch):
 *  - `plan` / `default`  → only read-only tools auto-run; every consequential tool asks.
 *  - `acceptEdits`       → file-edit tools also auto-run; bash, network, and the rest still ask.
 *  - `bypassPermissions` is intentionally NOT honored as allow-all here — telecode never surrenders the
 *    gate, so it falls through to the conservative consequential-asks behavior.
 *
 * Anything not on an allowlist asks — unknown/new tools fail safe (toward a human decision).
